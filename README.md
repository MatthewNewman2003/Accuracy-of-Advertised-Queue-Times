# Accuracy-of-Advertised-Queue-Times
This repository contains the code behind an analysis I performed into the accuracy of advertised theme park queue times.

The code consists of two files; one calculating statistics and showing visualisations to show the accuracy of advertised queue times at Alton Towers, and the other calculating statistics and showing visualisations to show the accuracy of advertised queue times in the UK Merlin theme park estate more widely. The code is in Python, and contains various calculated statistics and data visualisations.

The analysis found that in both Alton Towers and the UK Merlin theme park estate more widely, there was a moderate-to-strong positive correlation between advertised and actual queue time, indicating that advertised queue time is generally a good, but not perfect, indicator of actual queue time. Further to this, the analysis also found that when treating the discrepancies as vector quantities, the mean and median discrepancies were low, indicating that neither Alton Towers nor the UK Merlin estate more widely can be relied upon to overstate or understate queue times. When the discrepancies were treated as absolute scalar quantities, it was found that the average discrepancy between advertised and actual queue time lied at 5-15 minutes, or 20-60% of the advertised queue time in proportional terms. Therefore, the analysis found that advertised queue times are decent as a broad indicator of actual queue time, but should not be relied upon for a particularly reliable exact estimate of queue time.
